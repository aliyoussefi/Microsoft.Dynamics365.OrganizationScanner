## Explanation of Virtual Table
The Solution History Recorder will poll the Dataverse API as a service principal to get all solution history records for today. Once retrieved, the data is written to a CSV file.
This CSV file is within a container that is used as an external table for a SERVERLESS Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Pool. Using queries across databases, we can join history to solution.

Alternatively you can write this data to Azure Log Analytics and be alerted when a new solution history appears.

## Why is this needed?
Virtual tables are not exposed within Power Automate natively requiring connecting to the API similar to this solution.
Low code can be used here and potentially will be added to this repo.

# Example SQL Query
The sample query is located here: Microsoft.Dynamics365.OrganizationScanner\CREATE_TABLE_SOLUTION_HISTORY.sql
![alt text](CREATE_TABLE_SOLUTION_HISTORY.sql "Solution History SQL Table Create")
```SQL 
SELECT TOP (1000) [msdyn_solutionhistoryid]
      ,[msdyn_solutionid]
      ,[msdyn_endtime]
      ,[msdyn_starttime]
