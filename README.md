# Summary
This repo showcases how to read the async operation table and deliver to Application Insights.

# Architecture
![alt text](./_artifacts/ArchitectureDiagram.JPG "Architecture Diagram")

# How to Deploy
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open solution in Visual Studio.
3. Right-click on Microsoft.Dynamics365.OrganizationScanner project.
4. Select Publish.
5. Go through steps to push to Azure Function.

# Example Kusto Query for Async Operations
customEvents
|extend cd = parse_json(customDimensions)
|project JobName_Status = strcat(name , " - ", tostring(cd.StatusName)), toint(cd.StatusCount), timestamp
//|where JobName_Status contains "Retrieve of ayw_"
|render timechart

# Explanation of Virtual Table
The Solution History Recorder will poll the Dataverse API as a service principal to get all solution history records for today. Once retrieved, the data is written to a CSV file.
This CSV file is within a container that is used as an external table for a SERVERLESS Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Pool. Using queries across databases, we can join history to solution.

Alternatively you can write this data to Azure Log Analytics and be alerted when a new solution history appears.

## Why is this needed?
Virtual tables are not exposed within Power Automate natively requiring connecting to the API similar to this solution.
Low code can be used here and potentially will be added to this repo.

# Example SQL Query
The sample query is located here: Microsoft.Dynamics365.OrganizationScanner\CREAT_TABLE_SOLUTION_HISTORY.sql
![alt text](CREAT_TABLE_SOLUTION_HISTORY.sql "Solution History SQL Table Create")
```SQL 
SELECT TOP (1000) [msdyn_solutionhistoryid]
      ,[msdyn_solutionid]
      ,[msdyn_endtime]
      ,[msdyn_starttime]
